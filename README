Turnstile Module
===========================
Turnstile is an extension that allows the integration of the Cloudflare Turnstile
anti-spam CAPTCHA service in your eZ Publish content objects. Turnstile
provides a Turnstile datatype that can be used in editing content and
information collection.

Installation
-----------------
Follow these steps to add the Turnstile module to your eZ publish installation:

  1) Place the extension files in your eZ Publish /extension directory
     (e.g., /extension/turnstile if you create a subdirectory, or place files directly)

  2) Activate the extension. Edit site.ini.append in /settings/override (or your siteaccess settings). Add the following lines if they don't exist, or add 'turnstile' to the existing arrays:

       [ExtensionSettings]
       ActiveExtensions[]=turnstile

       [TemplateSettings]
       ExtensionAutoloadPath[]=turnstile

       [RegionalSettings]
       TranslationExtensions[]=turnstile

       [DataTypeSettings]
       ExtensionDirectories[]=turnstile
       AvailableDataTypes[]=turnstile

       [ModuleSettings]
       ExtensionRepositories[]=turnstile
       ModuleList[]=turnstile

  3) Visit https://dash.cloudflare.com/ to sign up for a Cloudflare account (if you don't have one) and get your Turnstile Site Key and Secret Key.

  4) Edit extension/turnstile/settings/turnstile.ini.append.php (or settings/turnstile.ini.append.php if installed at root) and add your API keys (SiteKey and SecretKey).

  5) Clear Cache (e.g., using `php bin/php/ezcache.php --clear-all`)

Usage
----------------
To use, simply add a Turnstile attribute to your content class.
